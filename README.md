## About Third Rate
The purpose of Third Rate is to provide a resource for those of us who work remotely. Maybe you have an office, and maybe you enjoy working from home, but sometimes you just need to go to a third space to focus and get things done. That's where Third Rate comes in.

Here you will find spaces to work from, rated by fellow remote workers. The ratings are based on criteria specific to being able to focus and work, not on food offerings, prices, etc (though, these may contribute to the overall rating).
